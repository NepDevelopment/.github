# Neptune Development

# Plans:
**Neptune MultiTool** (*In Development*)
- A fully Batch coded MultiTool containing many utilities and CyberSecurity modules
- Mostly inspired by [RedTiger Tools](https://github.com/loxy0dev/RedTiger-Tools)

**batRAT** (*In Development*)
- A fully Batch coded RAT that infiltrates and operates via Discord Bot
- Inspired by [PySilon](https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware)

**XLora** (*In Development*)
- A fully Python coded RAT Disguiser that poses as a Cheat Program and silently executes a file
- Looks extremely legit with an actually working Key System
- Account system and data runs through [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
